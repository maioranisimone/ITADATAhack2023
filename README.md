### Monty Hall Team
This repository documents the participation of our team of data scientist students from the University of Perugia in the ITADATAhack 2023, a national event dedicated to innovation in the field of data!

## Day 1
On the first day of the competition, we were presented with a balanced dataset containing duplicates. Our goal was to tackle a multiclass problem with a single output, where the label corresponded to the individual chapter of the law.

## Day 2
Day two introduced a new challenge. The dataset provided was unbalanced, and we had to address a multiclass problem with a single output, where the label now corresponded to both the chapter and subchapter of the law, totaling 87 labels.

## Day 3
The final day of the competition posed another twist. We were presented with an unbalanced dataset, and the goal was to solve a multioutput multiclass problem. Our task was to predict the possible pairs of chapter and subchapter to which the law belonged.

## Conclusion
Our journey in ITADATAhack 2023 competition was a great experience. We hope this README provides insight into our approach and the increasing difficulty of the competition. Please feel free to explore our code and results.
